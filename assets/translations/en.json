  "imc": "Body Mass Index",
  "imcDesc": "The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a useful tool for evaluating the relationship between a person's weight and height, providing an estimate of body fat.",
  "rmc": "Maximum Heart Rate",
  "rmcDesc": "Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) is the highest heart rate a person can reach during intense physical activity.",
  "pgc": "Body Fat Percentage",
  "pgcDesc": "Calculating body fat percentage is important for assessing body composition and overall health. There are different methods to estimate this percentage. Navy Formula: Uses waist and neck circumference (and hips for women) along with height to estimate body fat percentage. YMCA Formula: Based on height and weight to estimate body fat percentage, although it is less accurate than other methodologies. Calculating body fat percentage provides a more complete view of health and fitness than body weight alone. However, it's advisable to combine these methods with other health measures for a more accurate and holistic evaluation.",
  "pmm": "Lean Muscle Percentage",
  "pmmDesc": "Calculating lean muscle percentage is useful to gain a more detailed understanding of a person’s body composition. This percentage refers to the amount of muscle mass relative to total body weight, excluding fat.",
  "tmb": "Basal Metabolic Rate",
  "tmbDesc": "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of energy the body expends at rest to maintain vital functions such as breathing, blood circulation, body temperature regulation, and organ function. It is a key indicator of the body's energy needs at rest and serves as a basis for customizing workouts and nutrition plans. With a proper understanding of BMR, athletes and individuals interested in improving their health can optimize their performance and reach their goals more effectively and healthily.",
  "pgm": "Muscle Gain Prediction",
  "pgmDesc": "Predicting muscle gain based on genetics is important for several reasons, both for athletes and for individuals looking to improve their body composition. Genetics plays a fundamental role in a person's ability to gain muscle, and by recognizing its influence, training, nutrition, and recovery can be optimized. This not only improves results but also supports overall health and well-being, providing a more conscious and personalized approach to physical development. ",
  "cdm": "Daily Macronutrient Intake",
  "cdmDesc": "Knowing how daily macronutrient intake should be structured is essential for maintaining optimal health, achieving fitness goals, and improving physical performance. This involves not only a detailed understanding of macronutrients but also how they interact in the body and influence our daily lives. In the end, a well-planned and balanced diet is key to achieving a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. ",
  "mei": "Ideal Aesthetic Measurements",
  "meiDesc": "Knowing the aesthetically ideal measurements for different parts of the body can have several implications, both in terms of health and emotional well-being and self-esteem. It can guide the development of a training and nutrition plan and promote self-acceptance. However, it is important to approach this knowledge with a balanced mindset, considering personal health and well-being above social or cultural ideals. The key is to find an approach that promotes not only appearance but also personal health and happiness."
