  "pgc": "Body Fat Percentage",
  "pgcDesc": "Calculating body fat percentage is important for assessing body composition and overall health. There are different methods to estimate this percentage. Navy Formula: Uses waist and neck circumference (and hips for women) along with height to estimate body fat percentage. YMCA Formula: Based on height and weight to estimate body fat percentage, although it is less accurate than other methodologies. Calculating body fat percentage provides a more complete view of health and fitness than body weight alone. However, it's advisable to combine these methods with other health measures for a more accurate and holistic evaluation.",

It is a key indicator of the body's energy needs at rest and serves as a basis for customizing workouts and nutrition plans. With a proper understanding of BMR, athletes and individuals interested in improving their health can optimize their performance and reach their goals more effectively and healthily.",
  "pgm": "Muscle Gain Prediction",
  "pgmDesc": "Predicting muscle gain based on genetics is important for several reasons, both for athletes and for individuals looking to improve their body composition.
